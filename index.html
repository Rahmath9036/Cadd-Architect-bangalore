	Architecture at  CADD ARCHITECT-BANGALORE is different. We believe in the third space. We look for grey where there is only black and white. We’re about people. We use architecture and bold ideas to create social change. CADD ARCHITECT is on the cusp of total transformation, making it a unique centre for innovative design practice.
	
	Our students work on live projects that solve real design problems, working side-by-side with communities on an international scale. These projects culminate in spectacular public exhibitions, giving students the opportunity to showcase their work to industry and the local community. Cadd Architecture design studio is also like no other. An incredibly close-knit and supportive community, students have their own personal-work-station. It’s where inspiration and creativity thrives.
